# About
The DiscordLuau project is a collection of packages that enable developers to create Discord bots using the [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/) language, powered by the [Lune](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/) runtime.

> [!CAUTION]
> Here be dragons! DiscordLuau is yet to reach a stable `0.1.0` version on _ANY_ of its repositories, and breaking changes may often be made without warning. It is not recommended for use in production environments.
